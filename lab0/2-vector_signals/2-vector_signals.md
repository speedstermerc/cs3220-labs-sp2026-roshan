### **Declaring Vectors**

Vectors must be declared:

type [upper:lower] vector_name;

type specifies the datatype of the vector. This is usually wire or reg. If you are declaring a input or output port, the type can additionally include the port type (e.g., input or output) as well. Some examples:

```
wire [7:0] w;         // 8-bit wire
reg  [4:1] x;         // 4-bit reg... the [4:1] just create labels.
output reg [0:0] y;   // 1-bit reg that is also an output port (this is still a vector)
input wire [3:-2] z;  // 6-bit wire input (negative ranges are allowed)
output [3:0] a;       // 4-bit output wire. Type is 'wire' unless specified otherwise.
wire [0:7] b;         // 8-bit wire where b[0] is the most-significant bit.

```

The *endianness* (or, informally, "direction") of a vector is whether the the least significant bit has a lower index (little-endian, e.g., [3:0]) or a higher index (big-endian, e.g., [0:3]). In Verilog, once a vector is declared with a particular endianness, it must always be used the same way. e.g., writing `vec[0:3]` when `vec` is declared `wire [3:0] vec;` is illegal. Being consistent with endianness is good practice, as weird bugs occur if vectors of different endianness are assigned or used together.

### **Implicit nets**

Implicit nets are often a source of hard-to-detect bugs. In Verilog, net-type signals can be implicitly created by an `assign` statement or by attaching something undeclared to a module port. Implicit nets are always one-bit wires and causes bugs if you had intended to use a vector. Disabling creation of implicit nets can be done using the ``default_nettype none` directive.

`wire [2:0] a, c;   // Two vectors
assign a = 3'b101;  // a = 101
assign b = a;       // b =   1  implicitly-created wire
assign c = b;       // c = 001  <-- bug
my_module i1 (d,e); // d and e are implicitly one-bit wide if not declared.                    // This could be a bug if the port was intended to be a vector.`

Adding ``default_nettype none` would make the second line of code an error, which makes the bug more visible.

### **Unpacked vs. Packed Arrays**

You may have noticed that in *declarations*, the vector indices are written *before* the vector name. This declares the "packed" dimensions of the array, where the bits are "packed" together into a blob (this is relevant in a simulator, but not in hardware). The *unpacked* dimensions are declared *after* the name. They are generally used to declare memory arrays. See http://www.asic-world.com/systemverilog/data_types10.html for more details.

```
reg [7:0] mem [255:0];   // 256 unpacked elements, each of which is a 8-bit packed vector of reg.
reg mem2 [28:0];         // 29 unpacked elements, each of which is a 1-bit reg.

```

### **Accessing Vector Elements: Part-Select**

Accessing an entire vector is done using the vector name. For example:

```
assign w = a;
```

takes the entire 4-bit vector *a* and assigns it to the entire 8-bit vector *w* (declarations are taken from above). If the lengths of the right and left sides don't match, it is zero-extended or truncated as appropriate.

The part-select operator can be used to access a portion of a vector:

```
w[3:0]      // Only the lower 4 bits of w
x[1]        // The lowest bit of x
x[1:1]      // ...also the lowest bit of x
z[-1:-2]    // Two lowest bits of z
b[3:0]      // Illegal. Vector part-select must match the direction of the declaration.
b[0:3]      // The *upper* 4 bits of b.
assign w[3:0] = b[0:3];    // Assign upper 4 bits of b to lower 4 bits of w. w[3]=b[0], w[2]=b[1], etc. 
```

### Practice:

Build a circuit that has two 3-bit inputs that computes the bitwise-OR of the two vectors, the logical-OR of the two vectors, and the inverse (NOT) of both vectors. Place the inverse of `b` in the upper half of `out_not` (i.e., bits [5:3]), and the inverse of `a` in the lower half.

### **Bitwise vs. Logical Operators**

Earlier, we mentioned that there are bitwise and logical versions of the various boolean operators (e.g., [norgate](https://hdlbits.01xz.net/wiki/norgate)). When using vectors, the distinction between the two operator types becomes important. A bitwise operation between two N-bit vectors replicates the operation for each bit of the vector and produces a N-bit output, while a logical operation treats the entire vector as a boolean value (true = non-zero, false = zero) and produces a 1-bit output.

Look at the simulation waveforms at how the bitwise-OR and logical-OR differ.
